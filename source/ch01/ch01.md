# Basic elements of a C program
A C Program contains:

1. Functions: A function contains statements that specify the computing
   operation to be done. A function has a name and usually returns a value.

2. Variables: A variable is a label or a name given to a value. Often we phrase
   it as "A variable stores a value."

3. Statements: A statement is a part of a function. A function has a list of
   statements that are either seperated by semi-colons or by curly braces.
